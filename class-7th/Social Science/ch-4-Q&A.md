## **B. Long Answer Questions with Answers**

1. **Describe the features of Mahājanapadas.**
   Mahājanapadas were large kingdoms by the 8th–7th centuries BCE, with fortified capitals and organised armies. They collected taxes from farmers, traders, and craftsmen. Some, like Magadha, were monarchies, while others, like Vajji, had assemblies with shared power.

2. **Explain the differences between monarchies and gana-sanghas.**

   * **Monarchies:** King had supreme power; rule was hereditary; ministers and assemblies advised him. Example: Magadha.
   * **Gana-sanghas:** Power was shared among members of an assembly; decisions taken by discussion or voting; leaders were often elected. Example: Vajji.

3. **How did iron technology change agriculture and economy?**
   Iron tools like ploughs and sickles improved farming efficiency, allowing cultivation of tougher soils. Iron weapons strengthened armies. Surplus production boosted trade and urban growth.

   Trade flourished using punch-marked coins. Roads like Uttarapatha and Dakṣiṇapatha connected distant regions. River routes were used for transporting goods. Ports in the south linked India to Central and Southeast Asia.
