Here‚Äôs a summarized version of **Chapter 2 ‚Äì Exploring Substances: Acidic, Basic, and Neutral** for Class 7, along with teaching suggestions:

## üß™ **Chapter Summary: Exploring Substances: Acidic, Basic, and Neutral**

### üîπ 1. **Introduction**

* The chapter begins with a science fair where students observe a magical message appearing with a spray‚Äîthis introduces **acid-base indicators**.
* The goal is to explore how substances react using natural indicators.

---

### üîπ 2. **Acids, Bases, and Neutrals**

* **Acids**: Taste sour, turn **blue litmus red**, examples include lemon juice, vinegar.
* **Bases**: Taste bitter, feel soapy, turn **red litmus blue**, examples include soap, baking soda.
* **Neutrals**: Do not change the color of either litmus; examples include water, sugar solution.

---

### üîπ 3. **Indicators**

**Indicators** are substances that show color changes in acidic or basic conditions.

#### ‚úÖ **Natural Indicators Used in this Chapter:**

1. **Litmus** (from lichens)

   * Blue litmus turns **red** in acid.
   * Red litmus turns **blue** in base.

2. **Red Rose Petal Extract**

   * Red in acids, green in bases.

3. **Turmeric**

   * Turns **red** in bases.
   * No color change in acids or neutrals.

4. **Olfactory Indicators** (change in smell)

   * Onion smell changes in bases but not in acids.

---

### üîπ 4. **Neutralisation Reaction**

When an acid reacts with a base, it forms:

> **Salt + Water + Heat**

**Examples from daily life:**

* Ant bite (formic acid) ‚Üí apply **baking soda** (a base).
* Acidic soil ‚Üí treat with **lime** (base).
* Industrial acidic waste ‚Üí treat before releasing into lakes.

## üë©‚Äçüè´ How to Start the Lesson (Pedagogy)

**Engaging Question:**

> "Have you ever noticed the color of a turmeric stain changing when you apply soap?"

**Activity-based Opening:**

* Show a litmus paper experiment or magic message using turmeric + soap.

**Connect with real life:**

* Ask: ‚ÄúWhat do you feel when you taste lemon or soap?‚Äù
