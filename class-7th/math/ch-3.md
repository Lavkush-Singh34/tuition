## **1. Rotation of the Earth**

* **Definition:** The spinning of Earth on its axis from west to east.
* **Time taken:** 24 hours (1 day).
* **Effects:**

  * Day and night cycle.
  * Apparent movement of the Sun across the sky.
  * Differences in time between places (time zones).

---

## **2. Revolution of the Earth**

* **Definition:** The movement of Earth around the Sun in a fixed path called an orbit.
* **Time taken:** 365¼ days (1 year).
* **Effects:**

  * Causes seasons.
  * Changes in the length of day and night.
  * Variation in the Sun’s apparent position (north or south shift).

---

## **3. Axis of the Earth**

* **Definition:** An imaginary line passing through the North Pole and South Pole.
* **Tilt:** 23½° from the vertical.
* **Importance:** The tilt, along with revolution, causes changes in seasons.

## **4. Solstices**

* **Summer Solstice (21 June):**

  * Northern Hemisphere tilted towards the Sun.
  * Longest day and shortest night in the Northern Hemisphere.
* **Winter Solstice (22 December):**

  * Southern Hemisphere tilted towards the Sun.
  * Longest day and shortest night in the Southern Hemisphere.

## **5. Equinoxes**

* **Spring (Vernal) Equinox (21 March)** and **Autumn Equinox (23 September)**:

  * Sun shines directly on the equator.
  * Day and night are equal all over the world.

---

## **6. Leap Year**

* Because a year is 365¼ days, an extra day is added every four years (29 February) to keep the calendar year aligned with the astronomical year.

## **7. Importance of Earth's Motions**

* Rotation: Regulates daily life cycle (day/night), weather patterns, wind movements.
* Revolution: Regulates agricultural cycles, seasonal changes, and climate variations.
