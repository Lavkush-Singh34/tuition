**1. What is malleability? Give examples.**
Malleability is the property of metals by which they can be beaten into thin sheets. Examples: gold, silver, aluminium.

**2. Name a metal found in liquid state at room temperature.**
Mercury.

**3. What is ductility?**
The property of metals by which they can be drawn into wires, e.g., copper, aluminium.

**4. What is sonority?**
The property of metals to produce a ringing sound when struck.

**5. Why are cooking vessels made of metals?**
Because metals are good conductors of heat.

**6. Why are screwdriver handles made of plastic?**
Plastic is a poor conductor of electricity, so it prevents electric shock.

**7. What is corrosion?**
Gradual damage to metal surfaces caused by air, water, or other substances.

**8. What is rusting?**
Formation of brown deposits (rust) on iron when it comes in contact with moist air.

**9. How can rusting be prevented?**
By painting, oiling, greasing, or galvanising iron.

**10. What type of oxide is formed when magnesium burns in air?**
Basic oxide (magnesium oxide).

**11. What type of oxide is formed when sulfur burns in air?**
Acidic oxide (sulfur dioxide → sulfurous acid).

**12. Give two properties of non-metals.**
Non-metals are generally non-lustrous and poor conductors of heat and electricity.

**13. Name two non-metals essential in daily life.**
Oxygen (respiration), nitrogen (fertilisers).

**14. Why is sodium stored in kerosene?**
It reacts vigorously with oxygen and water, so kerosene prevents contact with air/moisture.

**15. What is an element?**
A substance that cannot be broken into simpler substances.


Alright — here’s the **full exam-prep set with answers** for the *World of Metals and Non-metals* chapter.

## **A. Short Answer Questions with Answers**

1. **What is malleability? Give two examples.**
   Malleability is the property of metals by which they can be beaten into thin sheets. Examples: gold and aluminium.

2. **Why is copper used for making electrical wires?**
   Because copper is a good conductor of electricity and is ductile, so it can be drawn into wires.

3. **What is corrosion? Give one example.**
   Corrosion is the gradual damage of metals by air, water, or other substances. Example: rusting of iron.

4. **Name two metals that are poor in malleability.**
   Sodium and potassium (they are soft and can be cut with a knife).

5. **Why are cooking vessels often made with metal handles covered in wood or plastic?**
   Metals conduct heat well, so handles are covered with wood/plastic (poor conductors) to prevent burns.

## **B. Long Answer Questions with Answers**

1. **Explain four physical properties of metals with suitable examples.**

   * **Lustre:** Metals are shiny (gold, silver).
   * **Malleability:** Can be beaten into sheets (aluminium foil).
   * **Ductility:** Can be drawn into wires (copper wires).
   * **Conductivity:** Good conductors of heat/electricity (iron, aluminium).

2. **Describe the rusting process and the conditions required for it.**
   Rusting is the formation of brown flakes (rust) on iron when exposed to moist air. It requires **both air (oxygen)** and **water**. Prevented by painting, oiling, greasing, or galvanising.

3. **Differentiate between metals and non-metals.**

| Property     | Metals          | Non-metals      |
| ------------ | --------------- | --------------- |
| Lustre       | Lustrous        | Non-lustrous    |
| Malleability | Malleable       | Not malleable   |
| Conductivity | Good conductors | Poor conductors |
| Oxides       | Basic           | Acidic          |

4. **Explain with examples how metals and non-metals react with oxygen.**

   * **Metals:** Form basic oxides. Example: Magnesium + Oxygen → Magnesium oxide (basic).
   * **Non-metals:** Form acidic oxides. Example: Sulfur + Oxygen → Sulfur dioxide → Sulfurous acid (acidic).

5. **Discuss the importance of non-metals in everyday life.**

   * **Oxygen:** Essential for breathing.
   * **Carbon:** Component of all living organisms.
   * **Nitrogen:** Used in fertilisers for plant growth.
   * **Chlorine:** Used in water purification.
   * **Iodine:** Used as an antiseptic.

## **D. True/False with Answers**

1. All metals are good conductors of electricity. **False** (e.g., mercury is poor conductor of heat).
2. Rusting occurs when iron is exposed to dry air only. **False** (needs air and water).
3. Sulfur dioxide forms a basic oxide when dissolved in water. **False** (forms acidic oxide).
4. Aluminium foil is used for food wrapping because it is malleable. **True**.
5. Sodium is stored in water to keep it safe. **False** (stored in kerosene).
