### üåü **Summary of Chapter 4: The World of Metals and Non-metals**

The chapter explores the **properties, uses, and reactions** of **metals and non-metals** through real-life observations and activities.

---

### üõ†Ô∏è **1. Interaction with Craftspersons**

* Yashwant and Anandi visit a village ironsmith to learn about metal tools like **tawas, axes, and spades**.
* They observe the use of **iron and coal** in shaping tools, initiating the discussion on the nature of metals.

---

### üîç **2. Properties of Metals and Non-metals**

#### üî® Malleability

* Metals like **copper, iron, and aluminium** can be beaten into thin sheets.
* Non-metals like **coal and sulfur** are brittle and break instead.

#### üîó Ductility

* Metals can be drawn into wires (e.g. copper wires in electricity).
* **Gold** is the most ductile metal.
* Non-metals cannot form wires.

#### üîî Sonority

* Metals produce a **ringing sound** when struck.
* Non-metals produce dull sounds.

#### üî• Conduction of Heat

* Metals (e.g. copper) are good **conductors of heat**, hence used in cooking vessels.
* Non-metals and materials like **wood** are poor conductors.

#### ‚ö° Conduction of Electricity

* Metals are good **conductors of electricity**.
* Non-metals and insulators like rubber, wood, and plastic are poor conductors.

---

### üåßÔ∏è **3. Effect of Air and Water on Metals**

#### üß™ Rusting

* **Iron** rusts when exposed to **both air and water**.
* This rust is a form of corrosion, which weakens iron structures.
* **Rusting can be prevented** by painting, oiling, greasing, or galvanizing (zinc coating).

#### üèõ Fascinating Fact:

* The **Iron Pillar of Delhi**, over 1600 years old, has not rusted‚Äîshowcasing ancient Indian metallurgy.

---

### üî• **4. Reactions of Other Metals and Non-metals**

#### ‚öôÔ∏è Metal Reaction

* **Magnesium** burns with a white flame forming **magnesium oxide**, which is **basic** in nature.

#### üßÇ Non-metal Reaction

* **Sulfur** burns to form **sulfur dioxide**, which forms **sulfurous acid** in water‚Äî**acidic** in nature.
* **Phosphorus** is stored in water as it catches fire in air.

### üß™ **5. Key Differences Between Metals and Non-metals**

| Property     | Metals              | Non-metals              |
| ------------ | ------------------- | ----------------------- |
| Appearance   | Lustrous (shiny)    | Usually dull            |
| Malleability | Malleable           | Not malleable           |
| Ductility    | Ductile             | Not ductile             |
| Sonority     | Sonorous            | Not sonorous            |
| Conductivity | Good conductors     | Poor conductors         |
| Oxide nature | Basic oxides        | Acidic oxides           |
| Air & water  | May corrode or rust | Do not rust like metals |

### ‚ù§Ô∏è **6. Importance of Non-metals**

* **Oxygen** is essential for breathing.
* **Carbon** forms the basis of life.
* **Nitrogen** is vital for plant growth.
* **Chlorine** is used in water purification.
* **Iodine** acts as an antiseptic.

---

### üß† **In a Nutshell**

* Metals and non-metals have **distinct physical and chemical properties**.
* These properties define their **uses in daily life**, from cookware and wires to fertilizers and medicines.
* The chapter emphasizes **scientific thinking** and how traditional knowledge, like Indian metallurgy, aligns with modern science.

Here are **important questions and answers** along with **MCQs** from **Chapter 4: The World of Metals and Non-metals** (Class 7 Science):

---

## üìò **Short Questions & Answers**

### 1. **What is malleability? Give an example.**

**Ans:** Malleability is the property of a material that allows it to be beaten into thin sheets without breaking.
**Example:** Gold and aluminium are malleable.

---

### 2. **What is ductility? Name two ductile metals.**

**Ans:** Ductility is the property of a material that allows it to be drawn into thin wires.
**Examples:** Copper and gold are ductile metals.

---

### 3. **Define sonority. Which type of substances are sonorous?**

**Ans:** Sonority is the ability of a material to produce a ringing sound when struck.
**Metals** are sonorous.

---

### 4. **What is rusting? What are the necessary conditions for rusting to occur?**

**Ans:** Rusting is the formation of brown flakes (iron oxide) on iron objects when they react with moisture and oxygen.
**Conditions:** Presence of both **air (oxygen)** and **water (moisture)**.

---

### 5. **How can rusting be prevented?**

**Ans:** Rusting can be prevented by:

* Painting
* Oiling/greasing
* Galvanisation (coating with zinc)

---

### 6. **Why do metals conduct heat and electricity, but non-metals don‚Äôt?**

**Ans:** Metals have free-moving electrons that carry heat and electricity efficiently. Non-metals lack such electrons, so they are poor conductors.

---

### 7. **What are the main differences between metals and non-metals?**

**Ans:**

| Property     | Metals           | Non-metals      |
| ------------ | ---------------- | --------------- |
| Appearance   | Lustrous (shiny) | Dull            |
| Conductivity | Good conductors  | Poor conductors |
| Malleability | Malleable        | Not malleable   |
| Ductility    | Ductile          | Not ductile     |

* **Sulfur + Oxygen ‚Üí Sulfur dioxide** ‚Üí **Sulfurous acid** (Acidic in nature)

---

### 9. **Why is sodium stored in kerosene?**

**Ans:** Sodium reacts violently with air and water, releasing a lot of heat. So it is stored in kerosene to prevent contact with air and moisture.
