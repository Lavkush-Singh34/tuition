**1. What is an electric cell?**
An electric cell is a portable source of electrical energy with two terminals – positive (+) and negative (–).

**2. Which part of an incandescent lamp glows?**
The thin wire inside the bulb, called the filament, glows when current passes through it.

**3. What is a battery?**
A battery is a combination of two or more cells connected so the positive terminal of one is joined to the negative terminal of the next.

**4. How is an LED different from an incandescent lamp?**
An LED has no filament and allows current to pass only in one direction; it has a longer positive wire and a shorter negative wire.

**5. What is an electrical circuit?**
A complete path that allows electric current to flow from the positive to the negative terminal of a cell.

**6. What does a switch do in a circuit?**
A switch completes (ON) or breaks (OFF) the circuit to control the flow of current.

**7. What is a circuit diagram?**
A representation of an electrical circuit using standard symbols.

**8. What are conductors?**
Materials that allow electric current to pass easily, like metals.

**9. What are insulators?**
Materials that do not allow electric current to pass, like rubber, plastic, or glass.

**10. Why are wires covered with plastic or rubber?**
To insulate and protect people from electric shocks.

**11. In which direction is electric current taken to flow in a circuit?**
From the positive terminal to the negative terminal of a cell.

**12. Why might an incandescent lamp not glow even if connected to a cell?**
Because its filament may be broken (fused), stopping current flow.

**13. What type of current do cells provide?**
Direct Current (DC).

**14. What type of current comes from wall sockets?**
Alternating Current (AC).

**15. Give one example each of a conductor and an insulator used in circuits.**
Conductor – copper wire; Insulator – rubber covering of wire.

If you want, I can also make **50+ MCQ and True/False** from this chapter so students can revise more thoroughly. Would you like me to prepare that?
