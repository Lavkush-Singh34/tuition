### **Long Answer Questions**

11. **Explain how Tenali Rama used the example of paddy seeds to make the king realise his mistake.**
    Tenali Rama presented special paddy seeds to the court, claiming they would produce triple the yield. When courtiers mocked him, the king said such seeds would need special care. Rama replied that the real issue was with the person sowing them and added that if someone yawned while sowing, the seeds would scatter unevenly. This made the court laugh and reminded the king of the quarrel with the queen. The king realised yawning was natural and not a sign of disrespect, leading him to reconcile with the queen.

12. **Describe the relationship between Krishnadeva Raya and Tenali Ramakrishna.**
    Krishnadeva Raya valued Tenali Ramakrishna for his wit, humour, and wisdom. Tenali was both a poet and an advisor in the court. He was trusted with solving sensitive matters, such as the quarrel between the king and queen, and his clever strategies helped maintain harmony in the royal household.

13. **What lesson does the story ‘Wit and Wisdom’ teach us?**
    The story teaches that misunderstandings can arise from small incidents, but they can be resolved with patience, wisdom, and humour. It also shows that pride should not prevent reconciliation and that natural actions like yawning should not be misinterpreted.
