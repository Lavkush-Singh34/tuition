### Unit -1 ** WIT AND WISDOM **


The Vijayanagara Empire was renowned for its glory, wealth,
and cultural achievements. Among its many illustrious rulers,
King Krishnadeva Raya (ruled 1509–29 CE) stood out as a wise
and powerful monarch. His reign is often referred to as the
Golden Era of the Vijayanagara Empire, a
time when art, literature, and architecture
flourished. A great patron of learning,
Krishnadeva Raya was not only an eminent
warrior but also a gifted poet. His works,
such as the epic Amuktamalyada and the
Sanskrit drama Jambavati Parinayam, are
acclaimed even today.

Krishnadeva Raya’s court was home to eight celebrated poets,
collectively known as the Ashtadiggajas. These poets, including
Allasani Peddana and Tenali Ramakrishna, enriched the literary
tradition with their masterpieces. Tenali Ramakrishna, in
particular, was known for his quick wit and humour, earning
him a special place in the king’s court as both a poet and a witty
advisor. His clever solutions to seemingly insurmountable
problems made him a beloved figure in the empire’s history.
Even the wisest rulers face moments of disharmony, and at one
such time, the king had a quarrel with his queen, Thirumalambal,
over a seemingly trivial matter. For weeks, he did not utter a
single word to her, and in his frustration, stopped visiting her
altogether. His absence cast a shadow over the palace, and the
once cheerful corridors seemed quiet and forlorn.

Thirumalambal, distraught and upset, tried her best to resolve
the issue but failed. With no other alternative, she
decided to seek the help of Tenali Rama,
the court’s brilliant and witty poet. Rama
listened patiently as the queen recounted
the incident in detail.
“The king wrote a poem,” she began, her
voice trembling. “It was filled with vague
expressions—sun, moon, stars, beautiful
sky—but it made no sense. When he tried reciting it to his ministers, they all avoided him, making excuses.
It was late evening when he came to me, seeking an audience. He
began reciting it to me, but I was so exhausted after a tiring day
that I yawned— not once, but several times. The king thought I
was disrespecting his poem and stormed off. Since then, he has
not spoken to me. If I had known this would happen I would
have chosen another day. Help me, please, Rama. Only you can
help the king understand.”

Rama nodded thoughtfully. “If you like, I will try my best to
resolve this matter, Your Highness. But this needs a well-planned
approach, and I may need time to find the right strategy.” The
queen, who had placed her last hope in Rama, agreed and
thanked him profusely.
The next morning, the royal court was bustling with activity.
Ministers, scholars, and courtiers filled the courtroom, its
intricately carved pillars towering towards the high ceiling. Rays
of sunlight streamed through the open windows, illuminating
the floor adorned with exquisite rugs. Despite the lively chatter,
a tension hung in the air. The king sat on his ornate throne,
his expression stern, his sharp eyes scanning the room. It was
evident that the unresolved quarrel still gnawed at him.

The court discussion was centred on improving paddy cultivation
in the empire. One by one, the ministers rose to present their
ideas. Some suggested expanding irrigation networks, while
others advocated for better manure. Amid these suggestions,
Tenali Rama stood quietly at the edge of the court, observing
everyone with an amused smile.

Finally, the king called upon Rama. The chatter in the court died
down as all eyes turned to him. Rama approached the throne,
carrying a plateful of paddy seeds. Bowing low, he began, “Your
Majesty, I bring you a revolutionary type of paddy seeds. If
these are sown, the yield will be three times greater than the
current results.”
A murmur swept through the room. One of the courtiers, known
for his sarcasm, whispered just loud enough to be heard, “I
wonder if these are magic seeds! Next, he’ll claim they grow
without water.” Another muttered, “Perhaps he found them on
the moon!” Snickers rippled through the court.
The king frowned, unimpressed. “That sounds absurd,” he
muttered. “Such cultivation would need special soil, manure,
and pest and insect repellents. If, by chance, something were to
go wrong, our farmers would suffer.”

Rama smiled, unfazed. “That may be true, Your Majesty, but the
real issue lies not with the seeds themselves but with the person
who sows them.”

A hush fell over the court as Rama’s words hung in the air.
The king’s eyebrows furrowed. “What is wrong with the person
who sows the seeds? Speak clearly, Rama!” he roared.
Rama glanced around the court, his sharp gaze meeting the
sceptical eyes of the courtiers. “If one were to sow seeds without
proper care, no one would reap a good harvest,” he said, pausing
for effect. “And what if the person had a habit of yawning while
sowing? Wouldn’t the seeds scatter unevenly?”
The court erupted into laughter, the earlier sarcasm replaced
by genuine amusement. Even the king, caught off guard, sighed
and instinctively yawned. Rama watched him keenly, then
continued, “Your Majesty, is there anyone in this world who does
not yawn? It is as natural as breathing.”
The king’s expression shifted as realisation dawned. His mind
raced back to the quarrel with the queen. He remembered
scolding her harshly for yawning while he recited his poem.
He realised how unfair he had been. “If I had known that yawning
was not a sign of disrespect, I wouldn’t have taken her gesture
so personally,” he thought, regret filling his heart.

That evening, the king approached the queen with a softened
expression. “Thirumalambal,” he began, his voice gentle, “I have
been foolish. I see now that I overreacted. I let my pride blind
me. I’m so sorry.”
The queen, who had longed for this moment, smiled and replied,
“If you like, we can leave this quarrel behind us. I would very
much like to listen to your poem.”
Rama, who had orchestrated this settlement, felt victorious. The
king and the queen later presented him with valuable gifts for
his service. The royal couple’s bond was restored, and the palace
brimmed once again with joy and laughter.
