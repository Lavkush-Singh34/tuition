chapter -2 | A CONCRETE EXAMPLE


My next-door neighbour, Mrs. Jones,
has got a garden full of stones:
A crazy path, a lily pond,
a rockery and, just beyond
A sundial with a strange device,
which Mrs. Jones thinks rather nice.
My next-door neighbour, Mrs. Jones,
puts little plants between the stones
They are so delicate and small,
they don’t mean anything at all.
I can’t think how she gets them in,
unless she plants them with a pin.
My next-door neighbour, Mrs. Jones,
once asked me round to see her stones.
We stood and talked about a flower
for quite a quarter of an hour.
“Where is this lovely thing?” I cried.
“You’re standing on it,” she replied.

Sure, Lavkush! Here’s a line-by-line explanation of the poem **“A Concrete Example”** by Reginald Arkell, suitable for your Class 8 students. I’ll also suggest how you can start the topic and explain it effectively in class.

---

### How to start the topic in class:

You can begin by asking your students if they have ever seen a garden full of stones or plants growing between stones. Then, introduce the poem by telling them it’s about a neighbor and her unique garden. This will create curiosity.

### Line-by-line explanation:

**My next-door neighbour, Mrs. Jones,**

* The poet is talking about the lady who lives next to his house, named Mrs. Jones.

**has got a garden full of stones:**

* Mrs. Jones’s garden is not like a usual garden with lots of flowers and grass; instead, it is full of stones.

**A crazy path, a lily pond,**

* The garden has a strange, winding path and a small pond where lilies grow.

**a rockery and, just beyond**

* There is also a rockery, which means a collection of rocks arranged decoratively, and just past that...

**A sundial with a strange device,**

* There is a sundial (a device to tell time by the sun's shadow) that has an unusual or strange part attached to it.

**which Mrs. Jones thinks rather nice.**

* Mrs. Jones likes this strange sundial; she finds it attractive.

**My next-door neighbour, Mrs. Jones,**

* The poet repeats the subject, emphasizing the neighbor again.

**puts little plants between the stones**

* Mrs. Jones plants tiny plants carefully in the small spaces between the stones in her garden.

**They are so delicate and small,**

* These plants are very fragile and tiny.

**they don’t mean anything at all.**

* The poet feels these plants are so small that they seem unimportant or insignificant.

**I can’t think how she gets them in,**

* The poet is amazed and cannot understand how Mrs. Jones manages to plant such tiny plants among the stones.

**unless she plants them with a pin.**

* He jokes that maybe she uses a tiny pin to plant them because they are so small.

**My next-door neighbour, Mrs. Jones,**

* Again, the poet mentions his neighbor to keep the focus on her.

**once asked me round to see her stones.**

* Mrs. Jones invited the poet to come and see her stone garden.

**We stood and talked about a flower**

* They both spent some time talking about a particular flower.

**for quite a quarter of an hour.**

* They talked about the flower for about 15 minutes.

**“Where is this lovely thing?” I cried.**

* The poet was curious and asked where the beautiful flower was.

**“You’re standing on it,” she replied.**

* Mrs. Jones told him that the flower was right under his feet — he had been standing on it the whole time without noticing!

### to explain it effectively :

* **Use simple language:** Explain each line using easy words so students can easily understand.
* **Make it visual:** You can draw a rough picture of Mrs. Jones’s garden with stones, plants, a sundial, and a pond to help students visualize.
* **Ask questions:** For example, "Why do you think the poet was surprised by the plants?" or "What does it mean when Mrs. Jones says, ‘You’re standing on it’?"
* **Relate to students’ experiences:** Ask if they have ever overlooked something beautiful or important because it was too small or hidden.
* **Add humor:** The poem has a light, humorous tone — point out the funny idea of planting flowers with a pin.

### Important points for notes:

* Mrs. Jones has a unique stone garden.
* She carefully plants tiny plants between the stones.
* The poet finds the garden unusual and the plants insignificant at first.
* The poem ends with a surprise: the beautiful flower is right under the poet’s feet.
* Theme: Beauty can be hidden in small or unexpected places.
