## **Long Answer Questions (5–6 sentences)**

1. **Describe how each of the four young men identified details about the camel without seeing it.**
   Ram Datt deduced lameness from uneven hoofprints. Shiv Datt noticed blindness in the right eye from untouched leaves on the right side. Har Datt inferred a short tail from mosquito bites visible along the trail. Dev Datt concluded the camel had stomach pain because of its cautious movement and uneven pressure on the legs. Their combined observations amazed the King, proving their wisdom and skill.

2. **How did the King respond to the merchant’s accusation and why?**
   The King listened to each man explain his reasoning. He realised their knowledge came from careful observation, not theft. Impressed by their logical thinking, he cleared them of all charges.
