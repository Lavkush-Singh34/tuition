*Wisdom Paves the Way*:

---

### **Detailed Summary**

The story *Wisdom Paves the Way* revolves around four young men — Ram Datt, Shiv Datt, Har Datt, and Dev Datt — who are travelling to Ujjain in search of work. They have been on the road for ten days and hope to secure an audience with the King of Ujjain, believing that he will recognise their talents and employ them. As they walk along a dusty road towards the city, they notice fresh camel tracks and decide to study them closely. Each man observes a unique detail about the camel, even though none of them has seen it.

While they are discussing their findings, a merchant appears in distress, searching for his lost camel. The men, one after another, describe the camel’s specific traits: it is lame in one leg, blind in the right eye, has a short tail, and is suffering from stomach pain. The merchant is astonished at their accuracy but becomes suspicious because they claim never to have seen the animal. Believing they must have stolen it, he takes them to the King’s court to face justice.

Before the King, the merchant accuses the four men of theft. The King listens patiently and asks each of them to explain their observations. Ram Datt explains that he deduced the camel’s lameness from the faint hoofprint of one leg. Shiv Datt says he inferred the blindness in the right eye because the camel had eaten leaves only from the left side of the path. Har Datt reasoned that the camel had a short tail because mosquito bites on its path showed it could not swat them away. Dev Datt concluded that the camel suffered stomach pain as it walked cautiously, putting less pressure on its hind legs.

The King, impressed by their sharp observation and logical reasoning, declares them innocent. He dismisses the merchant’s baseless accusation and warns him to be careful before blaming others in the future. Recognising the rare intelligence and wisdom of the four men, the King appoints them as his advisers. The story highlights the values of keen observation, logical thinking, patience in judgment, and the reward of integrity.
