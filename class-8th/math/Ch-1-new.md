The chapter introduces square numbers and cube numbers, their properties, and methods to identify them.

Lockers Puzzle: Demonstrates that only lockers numbered with perfect squares remain open because they have an odd number of factors.

Perfect Squares: Numbers obtained by multiplying a number by itself (n²). Key properties include:

End with digits 0, 1, 4, 5, 6, or 9.

Always have an even number of zeros at the end.

Can be expressed as the sum of consecutive odd numbers starting from 1.

Prime factorisation method can confirm if a number is a perfect square (all prime factors in pairs).

Square roots are the inverse operation of squaring.


Perfect Cubes: Numbers obtained by multiplying a number by itself three times (n³).

Cube numbers can end with any digit but follow certain patterns.

Prime factorisation can confirm if a number is a cube (all prime factors in triplets).

Cube roots are the inverse of cubing.


Patterns and History:

Differences between consecutive squares form odd numbers.

Consecutive odd numbers also relate to cubes.

Historical notes on ancient Indian terms for squares (varga) and cubes (ghana), and the origin of “root” in mathematics.

Famous story of Ramanujan and the Hardy–Ramanujan number 1729.



The chapter blends puzzles, number patterns, and historical context to deepen understanding of squares and cubes, along with their roots.
