## Topics Related to Cubes

1. **Definition of a Cube Number (Perfect Cube)**
   - A number obtained by multiplying an integer by itself three times (n × n × n = n³).
   - Examples: 1³ = 1, 2³ = 8, 3³ = 27, 4³ = 64.

---

2. **Perfect Cube Examples**
   - First 10 cubes: 1, 8, 27, 64, 125, 216, 343, 512, 729, 1000.

---

3. **Identifying a Perfect Cube by Prime Factorisation**
   - All prime factors must appear in **triplets**.
   - Example: 3375 = 3³ × 5³ → cube root = 15.
   - Example: 500 = 2² × 5³ → not a perfect cube (2 is not in triplet).

---

4. **Notation**
   - n³ is read as “n cubed.”
   - Examples: 5³ = 125, 8³ = 512, 10³ = 1000.

---

5. **Properties of Perfect Cubes**
   - Last digit patterns: possible endings are 0, 1, 4, 5, 6, 9, 2, 3, 7, 8 (all digits possible but with fixed root endings).
     - If cube ends in 1 → root ends in 1.
     - Ends in 4 → root ends in 4.
     - Ends in 5 → root ends in 5.
     - Ends in 6 → root ends in 6.
     - Ends in 9 → root ends in 9.
     - Ends in 2 → root ends in 8.
     - Ends in 3 → root ends in 7.
     - Ends in 7 → root ends in 3.
     - Ends in 8 → root ends in 2.
     - Ends in 0 → root ends in 0.
   - Example: Cube ending in 7 → root ends in 3 → ³√343 = 7.

---

6. **Pattern of Consecutive Odd Numbers**
   - Cubes can be expressed as the sum of consecutive odd numbers:
     - 1 = 1³
     - 3 + 5 = 8 = 2³
     - 7 + 9 + 11 = 27 = 3³
     - 13 + 15 + 17 + 19 = 64 = 4³
     - 21 + 23 + 25 + 27 + 29 = 125 = 5³.

---

7. **Cube Roots**
   - Inverse operation of cubing.
   - Example: ³√64 = 4 because 4³ = 64.
   - Every perfect cube has **one integer cube root** (positive for positive numbers, negative for negative numbers).

---

8. **Cube of a Fraction or Decimal**
   - (a/b)³ = a³ / b³.
   - Example: (4/6)³ = 64 / 216.
   - Example: (1.3)³ = 2.197.

---

9. **Special Numbers — Taxicab Numbers**
   - Numbers expressible as the sum of two cubes in two different ways.
   - Example: 1729 = 1³ + 12³ = 9³ + 10³.
   - Next examples: 4104, 13832.

---

10. **Successive Differences in Cubes**
    - When taking successive differences of perfect cubes, all differences become constant at the third level.
    - Example:
      - 1, 8, 27, 64, 125 → 1st diff: 7, 19, 37, 61 → 2nd diff: 12, 18, 24 → 3rd diff: 6, 6.

---

11. **Historical Notes**
    - In ancient Sanskrit, cube was called **ghana**.
    - Cube root was called **ghana-mula**.
    - Used in India at least from the 3rd century BCE.

## Tips and Tricks to Find the Cube of a Number

### 1. **Using (a + b)³ Formula**
- Formula: (a + b)³ = a³ + 3a²b + 3ab² + b³
- Example: 12³ = (10 + 2)³  
  = 1000 + 3×100×2 + 3×10×4 + 8  
  = 1000 + 600 + 120 + 8 = 1728.

---

### 2. **Using (a – b)³ Formula**
- Formula: (a – b)³ = a³ – 3a²b + 3ab² – b³
- Example: 98³ = (100 – 2)³  
  = 1,000,000 – 3×10,000×2 + 3×100×4 – 8  
  = 1,000,000 – 60,000 + 1,200 – 8 = 941,192.

---

### 3. **Cubes of Numbers Ending in 5**
- Multiply the first part by the next higher number, then append 125.
- Example: 35³ → (3 × 4) = 12 → write "125" → **12,125**.
- Example: 75³ → (7 × 8) = 56 → write "125" → **56,125**.

---

### 4. **Cubes Near 10, 100, 1000**
- If number is close to a base power of 10, use binomial expansion.
- Example: 101³ = (100 + 1)³  
  = 1,000,000 + 3×10,000×1 + 3×100×1 + 1  
  = 1,000,000 + 30,000 + 300 + 1 = 1,030,301.

---

### 5. **Cubes Using (n² × n)**
- First find n², then multiply by n again.
- Example: 24³ → 24² = 576 → 576 × 24 = 13,824.

---

### 6. **Cubes of Multiples of 10**
- Cube the number without the zero, then add triple the zeros.
- Example: 30³ = 27 × 1000 = 27,000.

---

### 7. **Ending Digit Trick for Finding Roots**
- Memorise cube ending patterns for quick reverse calculation:
  - Root ends in 0 → cube ends in 0.
  - Root ends in 1 → cube ends in 1.
  - Root ends in 2 → cube ends in 8.
  - Root ends in 3 → cube ends in 7.
  - Root ends in 4 → cube ends in 4.
  - Root ends in 5 → cube ends in 5.
  - Root ends in 6 → cube ends in 6.
  - Root ends in 7 → cube ends in 3.
  - Root ends in 8 → cube ends in 2.
  - Root ends in 9 → cube ends in 9.

---

### 8. **Cubes of Fractions**
- (a/b)³ = a³ / b³.
- Example: (4/5)³ = 64/125.

---

### 9. **Cubes of Decimal Numbers**
- Remove the decimal, cube the whole number, then reinsert decimal (move point three times original decimal places).
- Example: (1.5)³ = 15³ / 1000 = 3375 / 1000 = 3.375.

---

### 10. **Special Cubes to Memorise**
- 1³=1, 2³=8, 3³=27, 4³=64, 5³=125, 6³=216, 7³=343, 8³=512, 9³=729, 10³=1000.
- Larger: 11³=1331, 12³=1728, 13³=2197, 15³=3375, 20³=8000, 25³=15625.

---

### 11. **Using Difference of Cubes Formula**
- a³ – b³ = (a – b)(a² + ab + b²).
- Example: To find 9³ quickly from 10³:  
  9³ = 1000 – (10 – 9)(10² + 10×9 + 9²)  
  = 1000 – 1×(100 + 90 + 81) = 1000 – 271 = 729.

---

### 12. **Cubes via Successive Odd Numbers**
- Cubes can be expressed as a sum of consecutive odd numbers.
- Example: 4³ = 13 + 15 + 17 + 19 = 64.

## Tips & Tricks to Find Cube Roots

### 1. **Prime Factorisation Method**
- Break the number into prime factors.
- Group the factors into **triplets**.
- Multiply one factor from each triplet to get the cube root.
- Example: ³√3375  
  3375 = 3³ × 5³ → root = 3 × 5 = 15.

---

### 2. **Last Digit Pattern Method (Perfect Cubes)**
- Memorise cube ending patterns to find the unit digit of the root:
  - Ends in 0 → root ends in 0
  - Ends in 1 → root ends in 1
  - Ends in 4 → root ends in 4
  - Ends in 5 → root ends in 5
  - Ends in 6 → root ends in 6
  - Ends in 9 → root ends in 9
  - Ends in 8 → root ends in 2
  - Ends in 7 → root ends in 3
  - Ends in 2 → root ends in 8
  - Ends in 3 → root ends in 7

---

### 3. **Two-Step Large Cube Root Shortcut**
- Step 1: Look at the **last digit** → decide unit digit using the table above.
- Step 2: Ignore the last 3 digits → find cube root of the remaining part (nearest perfect cube) → gives the tens digit.
- Example: ³√148877  
  - Last digit 7 → unit digit is 3.
  - Remaining 148 → nearest cube ≤ 148 is 125 (5³) → tens digit = 5.
  - Answer = 53.

---

### 4. **Cube Roots of Numbers Ending in Zeros**
- Remove triple zeros, find cube root of the rest, then add one zero for each group of 3 zeros removed.
- Example: ³√27000 = ³√27 × 10 = 3 × 10 = 30.

---

### 5. **Cube Roots of Fractions**
- ³√(p/q) = ³√p / ³√q.
- Example: ³√(64/125) = 4/5.

---

### 6. **Cube Roots of Decimals**
- Make decimal places a multiple of 3 by adding zeros.
- Then find cube root and adjust decimal point.
- Example: ³√0.008 = ³√(8/1000) = 2/10 = 0.2.

---

### 7. **Estimation for Non-Perfect Cubes**
- Find two perfect cubes between which the number lies.
- Example: ³√50 → between 27 (3³) and 64 (4³).  
  Closer to 64 → approx. 3.7.

---

### 8. **Memorise Small Cubes**
- 1³=1, 2³=8, 3³=27, 4³=64, 5³=125,  
  6³=216, 7³=343, 8³=512, 9³=729, 10³=1000.
- Helps in quick identification of cube roots.

---

### 9. **Checking Perfect Cube**
- Prime factors must be in triplets.
- Last digit should match cube ending pattern.
- Example: ³√512 → last digit 2 → root ends in 8 → check: 8³=512.
