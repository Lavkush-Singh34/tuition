## Tips and Tricks to Find the Square of a Number

### 1. **Using (a + b)² = a² + 2ab + b²**
- Split the number into a base and a small addition.
- Example: 47² = (40 + 7)²  
  = 40² + 2 × 40 × 7 + 7²  
  = 1600 + 560 + 49 = 2209.

---

### 2. **Using (a – b)² = a² – 2ab + b²**
- Useful when the number is just below a round number.
- Example: 98² = (100 – 2)²  
  = 10000 – 400 + 4 = 9604.

---

### 3. **Squares of Numbers Ending in 5**
- Rule: If the number ends in 5, multiply the first part by the next higher number, then append 25.
- Example: 35² → (3 × 4) = 12 → write "25" → **1225**.  
- Example: 95² → (9 × 10) = 90 → write "25" → **9025**.

---

### 4. **Squares Near 50**
- Formula: (50 + x)² = 2500 + 100x + x²  
  (50 – x)² = 2500 – 100x + x²
- Example: 53² = 2500 + 300 + 9 = 2809.  
- Example: 48² = 2500 – 200 + 4 = 2304.

---

### 5. **Using Difference of Squares**
- If you know two squares, you can find another using:  
  (a + b)² – (a – b)² = 4ab.
- Example: To find 41², use 40² + (2 × 40 × 1) + 1² → 1600 + 80 + 1 = 1681.

---

### 6. **Squares of Multiples of 10**
- Square the number without the zero, then add double the zeros.
- Example: 70² = 7² = 49 → add two zeros → **4900**.

---

### 7. **Squares Close to Known Squares**
- If you know 30² = 900, then:  
  31² = 900 + 30 + 31 = 961.  
  29² = 900 – 30 – 29 = 841.

---

### 8. **Squares of Two-Digit Numbers Using Base 100**
- Formula: (100 + x)² = 10000 + 200x + x²  
  (100 – x)² = 10000 – 200x + x²
- Example: 103² = 10000 + 600 + 9 = 10609.  
- Example: 97² = 10000 – 600 + 9 = 9409.

---

### 9. **Quick Check by Units Digit**
- Perfect squares can only end in 0, 1, 4, 5, 6, or 9.
- If a number ends in 2, 3, 7, or 8, it is **not** a perfect square.

---

### 10. **Using Successive Odd Numbers**
- Squares can be formed by adding consecutive odd numbers starting from 1.
- Example: 6² = 1 + 3 + 5 + 7 + 9 + 11 = 36.

---

### 11. **For Numbers Ending in 1**
- If a number ends in 1, square the tens part, add the tens part to itself, and place 1 at the end.
- Example: 21² = (2²=4) → 4 + 2 = 6 → write "1" → **441**.

---

### 12. **For Numbers Ending in 9**
- If a number ends in 9, increase to the next multiple of 10 and use (n – 1)² trick.
- Example: 39² = (40 – 1)² = 1600 – 80 + 1 = **1521**.

## Tips and Tricks to Find the Square Root of a Number

### 1. **By Prime Factorisation**
- Break the number into prime factors.
- Group the factors into pairs; multiply one from each pair to get the root.
- Example: √324  
  324 = 2² × 3⁴ → root = 2 × 3² = 18.

---

### 2. **By Subtracting Consecutive Odd Numbers**
- Keep subtracting 1, 3, 5, 7, ... until you reach zero.
- The number of steps = square root.
- Example: √36  
  36–1=35–3=32–5=27–7=20–9=11–11=0 → 6 steps → √36 = 6.

---

### 3. **Using Nearby Perfect Squares (Estimation)**
- Identify two perfect squares around the number.
- Example: √250 → between √225 (15) and √256 (16).  
  Closer to 256 → ≈ 15.8.

---

### 4. **Perfect Square Recognition by Units Digit**
- Squares end only in 0, 1, 4, 5, 6, or 9.  
- If a number ends in 2, 3, 7, or 8 → not a perfect square.
- Example: 327 ends in 7 → not a perfect square.

---

### 5. **Squares Ending with Certain Digits**
- If a square ends in 6, its root ends in 4 or 6.  
  Example: √1936 → last digit 6 → root ends in 4 or 6 → check 44²=1936 → root = 44.

---

### 6. **Using (a + b)² Expansion in Reverse**
- For numbers close to a known square, adjust accordingly.
- Example: √1024  
  Since 32² = 1024, root = 32.

---

### 7. **For Numbers Ending with Zeros**
- Remove an even number of zeros, find the root of the remaining part, then add the same number of zeros to the root.
- Example: √490000 → remove 4 zeros → √49 = 7 → add 2 zeros → 700.

---

### 8. **Square Roots of Fractions**
- √(p/q) = √p / √q.
- Example: √(49/64) = 7/8.

---

### 9. **Square Roots of Decimals**
- Make the decimal places even by adding zeros, then find the root.
- Example: √2.25 → √(225/100) → 15/10 = 1.5.

---

### 10. **Special Squares to Remember for Quick Roots**
- 1²=1, 2²=4, 3²=9, 4²=16, 5²=25, 6²=36, 7²=49, 8²=64, 9²=81, 10²=100.
- 15²=225, 20²=400, 25²=625, 30²=900, 40²=1600, 50²=2500, 100²=10000.

---

### 11. **Square Roots of Large Numbers (Estimation)**
- Example: √1936  
  Step 1: Between 40²=1600 and 50²=2500 → possible roots are 44 or 46.  
  Step 2: Try 44² = 1936 → root = 44.

---

### 12. **Checking if a Number is a Perfect Square**
- Last digit rule: ends in 2, 3, 7, 8 → not a square.  
- Sum of digits rule (for small checks): if sum of digits is 2, 3, 5, 6, 8 (mod 9), it’s not a square.  
  Example: 235 sum = 2+3+5=10 → 10 mod 9 = 1 → could be a square.
