## Topics Related to Squares

1. **Definition of a Square Number (Perfect Square)**
   - A number obtained by multiplying an integer by itself (n × n = n²).

2. **Lockers Puzzle Insight**
   - Only perfect square-numbered lockers remain open due to having an odd number of factors.

3. **Odd Number of Factors**
   - Perfect squares have an odd number of factors because one factor (the square root) repeats in a pair with itself.

4. **Notation**
   - n² is read as “n squared.” Example: 5² = 25.

5. **Perfect Squares Examples**
   - 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81, 100, etc.

6. **Properties of Perfect Squares**
   - Last digits: 0, 1, 4, 5, 6, or 9.
   - Never end with 2, 3, 7, or 8.
   - Have an even number of zeros at the end.

7. **Patterns in Squares**
   - Units digit patterns.
   - Sum of consecutive odd numbers pattern:  
     - 1 = 1²  
     - 1 + 3 = 4 = 2²  
     - 1 + 3 + 5 = 9 = 3², and so on.

8. **Identifying Perfect Squares**
   - By unit digit rules (certain endings are impossible).
   - By prime factorisation — all prime factors must be in pairs.
   - By expressing as a sum of consecutive odd numbers starting from 1.

9. **Square Roots**
   - Definition: The inverse operation of squaring.
   - Every perfect square has two integer square roots (+n and –n).
   - Symbol: √ (radical sign).
   - Finding square roots using:
     - Listing perfect squares.
     - Consecutive odd number subtraction method.
     - Prime factorisation method.
     - Estimation method (using nearby perfect squares).

10. **Special Patterns**
    - Difference between consecutive perfect squares is always an odd number.
    - Relationship between number of zeros in a number and in its square.

11. **Perfect Squares in Ranges**
    - Counting how many perfect squares lie within a given range (e.g., between 1–100, 101–200, etc.).

12. **Relationship with Triangular Numbers**
    - Certain sums of triangular numbers form perfect squares.
