## Topics Related to Squares

1. **Definition of a Square Number (Perfect Square)**
   - A number obtained by multiplying an integer by itself (n × n = n²).

2. **Lockers Puzzle Insight**
   - Only perfect square-numbered lockers remain open due to having an odd number of factors.

3. **Odd Number of Factors**
   - Perfect squares have an odd number of factors because one factor (the square root) repeats in a pair with itself.

4. **Notation**
   - n² is read as “n squared.” Example: 5² = 25.

5. **Perfect Squares Examples**
   - 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81, 100, etc.

6. **Properties of Perfect Squares**
   - Last digits: 0, 1, 4, 5, 6, or 9.
   - Never end with 2, 3, 7, or 8.
   - Have an even number of zeros at the end.

7. **Patterns in Squares**
   - Units digit patterns.
   - Sum of consecutive odd numbers pattern:  
     - 1 = 1²  
     - 1 + 3 = 4 = 2²  
     - 1 + 3 + 5 = 9 = 3², and so on.

8. **Identifying Perfect Squares**
   - By unit digit rules (certain endings are impossible).
   - By prime factorisation — all prime factors must be in pairs.
   - By expressing as a sum of consecutive odd numbers starting from 1.

9. **Square Roots**
   - Definition: The inverse operation of squaring.
   - Every perfect square has two integer square roots (+n and –n).
   - Symbol: √ (radical sign).
   - Finding square roots using:
     - Listing perfect squares.
     - Consecutive odd number subtraction method.
     - Prime factorisation method.
     - Estimation method (using nearby perfect squares).

10. **Special Patterns**
    - Difference between consecutive perfect squares is always an odd number.
    - Relationship between number of zeros in a number and in its square.

11. **Perfect Squares in Ranges**
    - Counting how many perfect squares lie within a given range (e.g., between 1–100, 101–200, etc.).

12. **Relationship with Triangular Numbers**
    - Certain sums of triangular numbers form perfect squares.

1. **Definition of a Square Number (Perfect Square)**
   - A number obtained by multiplying an integer by itself.
   - Examples: 3 × 3 = 9, 7 × 7 = 49, 12 × 12 = 144.

2. **Lockers Puzzle Insight**
   - Only perfect square-numbered lockers remain open because they have an odd number of factors.
   - Open lockers: 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81, 100.

3. **Odd Number of Factors**
   - Perfect squares have one repeated factor (square root) that makes the total number of factors odd.
   - Example: Factors of 36 → 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 9, 12, 18, 36 (9 factors).

4. **Notation**
   - n² is read as “n squared.”
   - Examples: 5² = 25, 8² = 64, 15² = 225.

5. **Perfect Squares Examples**
   - First 12: 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81, 100, 121, 144.

6. **Properties of Perfect Squares**
   - **Last digits**: 0, 1, 4, 5, 6, or 9.
     - Examples: 25 (ends in 5), 49 (ends in 9), 64 (ends in 4).
   - **Never end** with 2, 3, 7, or 8.
     - Examples: 32, 57, 78 are not perfect squares.
   - **Even number of zeros at the end**.
     - Example: 400 (20²), 36,0000 (600²).

7. **Patterns in Squares**
   - **Units digit patterns** repeat in cycles.
   - **Sum of consecutive odd numbers**:
     - 1 = 1²
     - 1 + 3 = 4 = 2²
     - 1 + 3 + 5 = 9 = 3²
     - 1 + 3 + 5 + 7 = 16 = 4²
     - 1 + 3 + 5 + 7 + 9 = 25 = 5².

8. **Identifying Perfect Squares**
   - **By units digit**:
     - Example: 74 ends in 4 → could be a square; 87 ends in 7 → definitely not a square.
   - **By prime factorisation**:
     - Example: 144 = 2⁴ × 3² (all factors in pairs → perfect square).
     - Example: 98 = 2¹ × 7² (2 has no pair → not a perfect square).
   - **By sum of odd numbers**:
     - Example: 36 → 1 + 3 + 5 + 7 + 9 + 11 = 36 → 6².

9. **Square Roots**
   - Inverse operation of squaring.
   - **Two integer square roots**: +n and –n.
     - Example: √49 = ±7.
   - **Finding square roots**:
     - Listing perfect squares: √225 = 15.
     - Subtraction method: 36 → 36–1=35–3=32–5=27–7=20–9=11–11=0 → 6 steps → √36=6.
     - Prime factorisation: 324 = 2² × 3⁴ → √324 = 2 × 3² = 18.
     - Estimation: √1936 → between 40² and 50², last digit 6 → 44² = 1936.

10. **Special Patterns**
    - **Difference between consecutive perfect squares** is always odd:
      - 4–1=3, 9–4=5, 16–9=7, 25–16=9.
    - **Zeros in squares**:
      - Example: 1200² has 4 zeros at the end; number had 2 zeros.

11. **Perfect Squares in Ranges**
    - **Between 1–100**: 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81, 100 (10 numbers).
    - **Between 101–200**: 121, 144, 169, 196 (4 numbers).

12. **Relationship with Triangular Numbers**
    - Adding two consecutive triangular numbers gives a perfect square.
    - Example: 3 (T₂) + 6 (T₃) = 9 = 3².
