#### **Short Answer Questions**

1. **Define a rational number.**
    
    - **Answer:** A rational number is defined as a number that can be written in the form `p/q`, where `p` and `q` are integers, and `q` is not equal to zero (`q ≠ 0`). Examples include -2/3, 6/7, and -9/5. Even whole numbers like 0, integers like -2, and natural numbers like 4 are rational numbers because they can be expressed in the `p/q` form (e.g., 4 can be written as 4/1).
2. **Explain why whole numbers are not closed under subtraction with an example.**
    
    - **Answer:** Whole numbers are not closed under subtraction because performing subtraction on two whole numbers does not always result in another whole number. For instance, if you subtract 7 from 5 (`5 - 7`), the result is -2, which is not a whole number. Whole numbers include 0, 1, 2, 3, and so on, but they do not include negative numbers.
3. **Is addition commutative for rational numbers? Provide an example to support your answer.**
    
    - **Answer:** Yes, **addition is commutative for rational numbers**. This means that for any two rational numbers `a` and `b`, `a + b = b + a`. An example provided is: `(-2/3) + (5/7) = 1/21` and `(5/7) + (-2/3) = 1/21`, demonstrating that the order of addition does not affect the sum.
4. **Why are rational numbers not closed under division?**
    
    - **Answer:** Rational numbers are **not closed under division** because division by zero is undefined. For any rational number `a`, the operation `a ÷ 0` cannot be performed and does not yield a rational number. However, if zero is excluded from the collection of rational numbers, then the remaining collection of rational numbers is closed under division.

#### **Long Answer Questions**

1. **Discuss the closure property for Whole Numbers, Integers, and Rational Numbers across all four basic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division). Summarize your findings in a table.**
    - **Answer:** The closure property states that if an operation is performed on any two numbers from a set, the result is also a member of that set.
        
        - **Whole Numbers**:
            
            - **Addition:** Closed. For any two whole numbers `a` and `b`, `a + b` is always a whole number (e.g., `0 + 5 = 5`).
            - **Subtraction:** Not closed. Subtracting one whole number from another may result in a negative number, which is not a whole number (e.g., `5 - 7 = -2`).
            - **Multiplication:** Closed. The product of any two whole numbers `a` and `b` is always a whole number (e.g., `0 × 3 = 0`).
            - **Division:** Not closed. Dividing one whole number by another may result in a fraction, which is not a whole number (e.g., `5 ÷ 8 = 5/8`).
        - **Integers**:
            
            - **Addition:** Closed. The sum of any two integers `a` and `b` is always an integer (e.g., `-6 + 5 = -1`).
            - **Subtraction:** Closed. The difference between any two integers `a` and `b` is always an integer (e.g., `7 - 5 = 2`, `-6 - 8 = -14`).
            - **Multiplication:** Closed. The product of any two integers `a` and `b` is always an integer (e.g., `5 × 8 = 40`).
            - **Division:** Not closed. Dividing one integer by another may result in a fraction, which is not an integer (e.g., `5 ÷ 8 = 5/8`).
        - **Rational Numbers**:
            
            - **Addition:** Closed. The sum of any two rational numbers `a` and `b` is always a rational number (e.g., `3/8 + (-5/7) = -19/56`).
            - **Subtraction:** Closed. The difference of any two rational numbers `a` and `b` is always a rational number (e.g., `(-5/7) - (2/3) = -29/21`).
            - **Multiplication:** Closed. The product of any two rational numbers `a` and `b` is always a rational number (e.g., `(-2/3) × (4/5) = -8/15`).
            - **Division:** Not closed. Division by zero is undefined for rational numbers. However, if zero is excluded, the collection of all other rational numbers is closed under division.
        
        **Summary Table:** | Numbers | Addition | Subtraction | Multiplication | Division | | :-------------- | :------- | :---------- | :------------- | :------- | | Rational numbers | Yes | Yes | Yes | No | | Integers | Yes | Yes | Yes | No | | Whole numbers | Yes | No | Yes | No | | Natural numbers | Yes | No | Yes | No |

### **Chapter 2: Linear Equations in One Variable**

#### **Multiple Choice Questions (MCQ)**

1. Which of the following is a linear expression? a) `x² + 1` b) `y + y²` c) **`2x + 1`** d) `1 + z + z² + z³`
    
2. In the equation `2x - 3 = 7`, the expression `7` is the: a) Left Hand Side (LHS) b) **Right Hand Side (RHS)** c) Variable d) Constant
    
3. What is the highest power of the variable in a linear equation in one variable? a) 0 b) **1** c) 2 d) Any integer
    
4. When solving an equation, what mathematical operation should be performed on both sides to maintain balance? a) Different operations b) Only addition or subtraction c) Only multiplication or division d) **The same mathematical operations**
    

#### **Short Answer Questions**

1. **What distinguishes an algebraic equation from an algebraic expression?**
    
    - **Answer:** An algebraic **equation** is an equality that involves variables and uses an equality (=) sign. It states that the value of the expression on the Left Hand Side (LHS) is equal to the value of the expression on the Right Hand Side (RHS). An algebraic **expression**, on the other hand, does not include an equality sign. For example, `2x - 3 = 7` is an equation, while `2x - 3` is an expression.
2. **Explain the concept of 'transposing' a term in the context of solving a linear equation.**
    
    - **Answer:** 'Transposing' a term in a linear equation means moving a term from one side of the equality sign to the other. This is achieved by performing the inverse operation on both sides of the equation. For instance, if you have `2x = x + 5`, to move `x` from the RHS to the LHS, you subtract `x` from both sides: `2x - x = x + 5 - x`. This simplifies the equation while maintaining its balance.
3. **How can equations with denominators be simplified before solving?**
    
    - **Answer:** Equations with denominators can be simplified by **multiplying both sides of the equation by the Least Common Multiple (LCM) of the denominators** of all the terms in the equation. This clears the denominators, converting the equation into a simpler form without fractions, which can then be solved using standard methods.

#### **Long Answer Questions**

1. **Solve the linear equation `5x – 2 (2x – 7) = 2 (3x – 1) + 7/2` and explain each major step.**
    - **Answer:** To solve the equation `5x – 2 (2x – 7) = 2 (3x – 1) + 7/2`, we follow these steps:
        
        1. **Simplify both sides by opening the brackets:**
            
            - LHS: `5x - 2(2x - 7) = 5x - 4x + 14 = x + 14`
            - RHS: `2(3x - 1) + 7/2 = 6x - 2 + 7/2`
            - Combine the constant terms on the RHS: `6x - 4/2 + 7/2 = 6x + (7-4)/2 = 6x + 3/2`
            - The equation becomes: `x + 14 = 6x + 3/2`
        2. **Transpose terms to group variables on one side and constants on the other:**
            
            - Transpose `x` to the RHS (by subtracting `x` from both sides): `14 = 6x - x + 3/2`
            - Simplify the RHS: `14 = 5x + 3/2`
            - Transpose `3/2` to the LHS (by subtracting `3/2` from both sides): `14 - 3/2 = 5x`
        3. **Simplify the constant side (LHS):**
            
            - Find a common denominator: `(28/2) - (3/2) = 5x`
            - Subtract the fractions: `25/2 = 5x`
        4. **Isolate the variable `x`:**
            
            - Divide both sides by 5: `x = (25/2) ÷ 5`
            - `x = (25/2) × (1/5)`
            - `x = 5/2`
        
        Therefore, the required solution is **`x = 5/2`**.

### **Chapter 3: Understanding Quadrilaterals**

#### **Multiple Choice Questions (MCQ)**

1. A simple closed curve made up of only line segments is called a: a) Circle b) Curve c) **Polygon** d) Open curve
    
2. What is the sum of the measures of the external angles of any polygon? a) 90° b) 180° c) **360°** d) Varies with the number of sides
    
3. Which of the following describes a trapezium? a) A quadrilateral with all sides equal. b) A quadrilateral with all angles equal. c) **A quadrilateral with a pair of parallel sides.** d) A quadrilateral with exactly two distinct consecutive pairs of equal length sides.
    
4. In a parallelogram, adjacent angles are: a) Equal b) Complementary c) **Supplementary** d) Perpendicular
    
5. The diagonals of a rhombus are: a) Equal in length b) Not perpendicular c) **Perpendicular bisectors of one another** d) Always bisect the angles
    

#### **Short Answer Questions**

1. **Differentiate between a convex polygon and a concave polygon.**
    
    - **Answer:** The primary difference lies in their diagonals. A **convex polygon** is a polygon where no portion of its diagonals lies in its exterior. Additionally, any line segment joining two points in the interior of a convex polygon lies wholly within its interior. In contrast, a **concave polygon** is one where at least some portion of its diagonals extends into its exterior, or a line segment joining two interior points can pass outside the polygon.
2. **State two properties of the diagonals of a parallelogram.**
    
    - **Answer:**
        1. The diagonals of a parallelogram **bisect each other** at their point of intersection.
        2. In general, the diagonals of a parallelogram **are not of equal length**.
3. **An electric pole, 14 metres high, casts a shadow of 10 metres. Find the height of a tree that casts a shadow of 15 metres under similar conditions.**
    
    - **Answer:** This is a case of direct proportion, as greater object height results in a greater shadow length. Let `h1` be the pole's height, `s1` its shadow, `h2` the tree's height, and `s2` its shadow. Given: `h1 = 14 m`, `s1 = 10 m`, `s2 = 15 m`. We need to find `h2`. For direct proportion, `h1/s1 = h2/s2`. `14/10 = h2/15` To solve for `h2`: `h2 = (14 * 15) / 10` `h2 = 210 / 10` `h2 = 21` Thus, the height of the tree is **21 metres**.
4. **Explain why a rectangle is a convex quadrilateral.**
    
    - **Answer:** A rectangle is a convex quadrilateral because all its interior angles are less than 180 degrees. More precisely, for any convex polygon, no portion of its diagonals lies in its exterior, and any line segment joining any two different points in its interior lies wholly in the interior of it. A rectangle satisfies these conditions.

#### **Long Answer Questions**

1. **Explain how a square is considered a quadrilateral, a parallelogram, a rhombus, and a rectangle. Also, describe the properties of its diagonals based on these classifications.**
    - **Answer:** A square possesses characteristics that allow it to be classified under several quadrilateral types:
        
        - **A quadrilateral:** A square is fundamentally a quadrilateral because it is a closed plane figure made up of four line segments.
        - **A parallelogram:** A square is a parallelogram because its opposite sides are parallel and of equal length. Since all sides of a square are equal, its opposite sides are automatically equal.
        - **A rhombus:** A square is a rhombus because it is a quadrilateral with all sides of equal length. All four sides of a square are, by definition, equal.
        - **A rectangle:** A square is a rectangle because it is a parallelogram with all angles equal to 90 degrees (right angles). Each angle of a square is 90 degrees.
        
        **Properties of a Square's Diagonals:** The diagonals of a square inherit properties from its classifications:
        
        - **Bisect one another:** This property comes from it being a parallelogram.
        - **Are of equal length:** This property comes from it being a rectangle.
        - **Are perpendicular to one another:** This property comes from it being a rhombus (specifically, a rhombus with equal angles).
        
        Therefore, the diagonals of a square are **perpendicular bisectors of each other** and **are of equal length**.
