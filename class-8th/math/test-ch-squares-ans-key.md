### Q1. Find the square of the following numbers: (5 Marks)

1.  17² = **289**
2.  25² = **625**
3.  (-13)² = **169**
4.  30² = **900**
5.  1.2² = **1.44**

---

### Q2. Check whether the following are perfect squares. Give a reason. (4 Marks)

1.  **196:** Yes, it is a perfect square. **Reason:** It can be expressed as the product of two equal integers (14 x 14 = 196).
2.  **250:** No, it is not a perfect square. **Reason:** Its prime factors are 2 x 5 x 5 x 5. Not all factors are in pairs.

### Q3. Find the square root using the prime factorization method: (6 Marks)

1.  **784:**
    *   Prime factors: 784 = 2 x 2 x 2 x 2 x 7 x 7
    *   Pairing: (2 x 2) x (2 x 2) x (7 x 7)
    *   Square root: 2 x 2 x 7 = **28**

2.  **1296:**
    *   Prime factors: 1296 = 2 x 2 x 2 x 2 x 3 x 3 x 3 x 3
    *   Pairing: (2 x 2) x (2 x 2) x (3 x 3) x (3 x 3)
    *   Square root: 2 x 2 x 3 x 3 = **36**

---

### Q4. Find the smallest whole number by which the following number should be multiplied to get a perfect square number: (3 Marks)

1.  **180:**
    *   Prime factors of 180 are 2 x 2 x 3 x 3 x 5.
    *   The prime factor 5 is not in a pair.
    *   Therefore, 180 must be multiplied by **5** to make it a perfect square (180 x 5 = 900, which is 30²).

### Q5. Word Problems (7 Marks)

1.  **A gardener has 1000 plants...**
    *   We need to find the smallest perfect square number greater than 1000.
    *   We know that 31² = 961 and 32² = 1024.
    *   The required number of plants for equal rows and columns is 1024.
    *   Minimum number of additional plants needed = 1024 - 1000 = **24 plants**.

2.  **The area of a square plot is 2304 m²...**
    *   Area of a square = side²
    *   Side = √Area = √2304
    *   To find √2304, we can use long division or prime factorization. √2304 = 48.
    *   The side of the square plot is **48 m**.
