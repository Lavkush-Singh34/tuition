## üü° **B. Short Answer Questions (2‚Äì3 marks)**

**Q7. What are the three main parts of a typical cell?**
**A:**

1. **Cell membrane** ‚Äì Controls entry and exit of substances.
2. **Cytoplasm** ‚Äì Site of cell activities.
3. **Nucleus** ‚Äì Controls cell functions.

**Q8. Write two differences between plant and animal cells.**
**A:**

* Plant cells have a **cell wall**; animal cells do not.
* Plant cells have **chloroplasts and large vacuoles**; animal cells have small or no vacuoles.

**Q9. What are microorganisms? Name any two.**
**A:** Microorganisms are tiny living organisms not visible to the naked eye.
Examples: Bacteria, Fungi.

**Q10. Why are viruses not considered fully living organisms?**
**A:** Because they can only reproduce inside living cells and are inactive outside.

## üîµ **C. Long Answer Questions (4‚Äì5 marks)**

**Q11. Explain the contributions of Robert Hooke and Antonie van Leeuwenhoek in discovering the invisible world.**
**A:**

* **Robert Hooke** observed cork cells using a microscope in 1665 and coined the term ‚Äúcell‚Äù.
* **Antonie van Leeuwenhoek** developed powerful lenses and was the first to observe bacteria, blood cells, and protozoa. He is known as the **Father of Microbiology**.

**Q12. Describe the structure and function of a typical cell.**
**A:**

* **Cell membrane:** Thin outer layer, controls material movement.
* **Cytoplasm:** Jelly-like material where most activities occur.
* **Nucleus:** Controls all cell functions and contains genetic material.
  Plant cells also have a **cell wall**, **chloroplasts**, and **large vacuoles**.

**Q13. Explain how microorganisms are useful in:
a) Environment
b) Food Production
c) Agriculture**
**A:**
a) **Environment:** Bacteria and fungi decompose waste into manure and recycle nutrients.
b) **Food Production:**

* Yeast ferments dough to make bread soft.
* Lactobacillus bacteria convert milk into curd.
  c) **Agriculture:**
* Rhizobium bacteria fix nitrogen in soil, improving fertility.

## üî¥ **D. Higher Order Thinking Questions (HOTS)**

**Q14. If there were no microbes on Earth, what would happen to waste materials and food chains?**
**A:**

* Waste would accumulate.
* Nutrient recycling would stop.
* Soil fertility would decrease.
* Food chains, especially in aquatic life, would collapse.

**Q15. Why are nerve cells long and branched while muscle cells are spindle-shaped?**
**A:**
Because structure relates to function:

* **Nerve cells** need to carry messages quickly across the body.
* **Muscle cells** need to contract and relax for movement.
