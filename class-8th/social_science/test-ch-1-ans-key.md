**Section B: Short Answer Questions (9 Marks)**

1.  **What is history? (2 Marks)**
    History is the study of changes that occur over time. It helps us understand how things were in the past and how they have changed.

2.  **Why is James Mill's division of Indian history considered problematic? (3 Marks)**
    James Mill's division of Indian history is considered problematic because it was based on the religion of the rulers. He divided it into Hindu, Muslim, and British periods, which ignored the rich diversity of the subcontinent and wrongly suggested that the periods before British rule were uncivilized.

3.  **What were the different types of surveys conducted by the British? (4 Marks)**
    The British conducted several types of surveys to effectively administer the country. These included:
    *   Revenue surveys
    *   Census surveys
    *   Botanical and zoological surveys
    *   Archaeological surveys
    *   Forest and anthropological surveys

**Section C: Long Answer Question (6 Marks)**

1.  **What are the different sources of information that historians use to study the past? Explain the limitations of official records. (6 Marks)**
    Historians use a variety of sources to study the past, which can be broadly divided into two categories:

    *   **Official Records:** These are documents produced by the government or other official bodies. The British, for example, kept meticulous records of their administration, including letters, memos, reports, and surveys. These are often preserved in archives.

    *   **Other Sources:** These include personal diaries, autobiographies of important personalities, accounts of pilgrims and travellers, popular booklets, newspapers, and the writings of poets and novelists.

    **Limitations of Official Records:**

    Official records have significant limitations. They are written from the perspective of the officials and the government, and therefore, they only present one side of the story. They tell us what the officials thought, what they were interested in, and what they wished to preserve for posterity. These records do not tell us about the lives and feelings of the common people in the countryâ€”the peasants, the tribals, the workers. To understand their experiences, historians need to look at other sources like diaries, newspapers, and oral histories.
