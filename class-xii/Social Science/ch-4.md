## **Summary**

After the decline of the Harappan civilisation (First Urbanisation) around 2000 BCE, urban life in India almost disappeared for a thousand years. People mostly lived in villages until a new phase of urbanisation began in the **1st millennium BCE**, known as the **Second Urbanisation**, centred in the fertile **Ganga plains**, spreading later to other parts of India.

### **Janapadas and Mahājanapadas**

* **Janapadas**: Small states led by a *rājā*, formed by clans with shared language and customs.
* **Mahājanapadas**: Larger kingdoms that emerged from merged janapadas by 8th–7th centuries BCE; 16 are mentioned in ancient texts (e.g., Magadha, Kosala, Vatsa, Avanti).
* Capitals were fortified with moats and narrow gates for security.
* Magadha, Kosala, and Avanti were powerful monarchies; Vajji and Malla had *gana* or *sangha* systems, where assemblies had more power — early forms of democracy.

### **Political Systems**

* Monarchies: King held supreme power, supported by ministers and assemblies; rule often hereditary.
* Republic-like States: Rulers chosen by assemblies; decisions taken by discussion or voting.

### **Technological and Economic Changes**

* Widespread use of **iron** for agriculture and weapons boosted productivity and warfare.
* **First coins** (punch-marked silver coins) facilitated trade within and beyond India.
* Growth of trade networks and cities; roads like **Uttarapatha** (northwest to east) and **Dakṣhiṇapatha** (north to south) linked regions.

### **Varṇa–Jāti System**

* Society organised into **varṇa** (Brahmin, Kshatriya, Vaishya, Shudra) and **jāti** (occupation-based communities).
* Originally more flexible but became rigid over time, leading to inequalities.
* Skills and professions often passed down generations.

### **Regional Developments**

* In the south, kingdoms like **Chola, Chera, Pandya** emerged by 400 BCE.
* Ports and trade centres connected India to Central and Southeast Asia.
* Cities like **Śhiśhupalgarh** (Kalinga) had planned layouts, fortifications, and active trade.

By 300 BCE, mahājanapadas disappeared, paving the way for large empires.
