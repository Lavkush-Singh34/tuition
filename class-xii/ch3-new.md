## ‚ö° **Chapter Summary: Electricity ‚Äì Circuits and Their Components**

### üî∑ 1. **Introduction**

* Electricity powers most modern devices: lights, fans, phones, computers, transportation, etc.
* Sources include: **hydropower**, **solar**, **wind**, **coal**, **gas**.
* For experiments, we use **safe sources** like batteries (cells).

---

### üî∑ 2. **Components of an Electric Circuit**

#### üîπ **Electric Cell**

* A small portable source of electrical energy.
* Has **two terminals**:

  * **Positive (+)** ‚Üí metal cap
  * **Negative (‚Äì)** ‚Üí metal disc

#### üîπ **Battery**

* Combination of two or more cells (positive of one to negative of another).
* Provides more power than a single cell.

#### üîπ **Electric Lamp (Bulb)**

* Contains a thin **filament** inside a glass bulb.
* When current flows, filament heats and glows.

#### üîπ **LED (Light Emitting Diode)**

* Has **no filament**; glows when current flows in correct direction.
* Two terminals:

  * **Long wire = Positive**
  * **Short wire = Negative**

#### üîπ **Switch**

* A device to **open or close** an electric circuit.
* **ON**: Current flows (circuit closed)
  **OFF**: No current (circuit open)

#### üîπ **Circuit**

* A **complete path** through which current flows from positive to negative terminal.

---

### üî∑ 3. **Circuit Diagrams**

* Use **symbols** for components (e.g., cell, battery, switch, lamp, LED).
* Helps in easy understanding and communication.

---

### üî∑ 4. **Conductors and Insulators**

#### ‚úÖ **Conductors**:

* Materials that **allow current** to pass.
* Example: **Metals (copper, aluminum, iron)**

#### ‚ùå **Insulators**:

* Materials that **do not allow current**.
* Example: **Plastic, rubber, wood**

## üë©‚Äçüè´ How to Start the Class

**Engage Students**:

> ‚ÄúWhat happens when we flip a switch and the fan starts spinning? How does that actually happen?‚Äù

**Show a Real Object**:

* Bring a torch and take out its cells.
* Show a bulb and LED.
* Let students feel wires, insulation.

**Lead with a Question**:

> ‚ÄúIf the bulb doesn‚Äôt glow, what might be the reason? Let‚Äôs find out today!‚Äù

## ‚úÖ Important Questions and Answers

1. **What is an electric circuit?**
   A complete path for electricity to flow from the positive to negative terminal of a cell.

2. **What are the two terminals of a cell?**
   Positive (+) and Negative (‚Äì)

3. **Why does a bulb glow in a circuit?**
   When current passes through its **filament**, it heats up and glows.

4. **What is the difference between an LED and a bulb?**

   * LED: No filament, glows in one direction only.
   * Bulb: Has filament, glows when heated.

5. **What is a conductor? Give examples.**
   Material through which current can pass. E.g., **copper, iron, silver**.

6. **What is an insulator? Give examples.**
   Material that does **not** allow current to pass. E.g., **rubber, plastic, wood**.

7. **Why are wires covered with plastic?**
   To prevent electric shock (plastic is an insulator).

## üî¨ Suggested Activities

1. **Make a simple circuit**: Cell + Bulb + Wires
2. **Create your own switch**: Using drawing pins and paper clip.
3. **Test conductors and insulators**: Touch different objects to open ends of circuit.
4. **LED experiment**: Connect LED properly to glow.
5. **Draw circuit diagrams** using symbols.
