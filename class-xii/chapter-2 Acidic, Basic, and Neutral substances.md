### âœ… **1. Define the following: Acidic, Basic, and Neutral substances.**

**Answer:**

* **Acidic substances**: These are substances that turn blue litmus paper red. They taste sour.
  *Examples: Lemon juice, vinegar*
* **Basic substances**: These are substances that turn red litmus paper blue. They feel slippery and may taste bitter.
  *Examples: Baking soda, soap solution*
* **Neutral substances**: These substances do not change the color of either red or blue litmus paper.
  *Examples: Sugar solution, tap water*

---

### âœ… **2. What is an indicator? Name two natural indicators.**

**Answer:**
An **indicator** is a substance that shows a **color change** when added to acidic or basic solutions.
**Two natural indicators** are:

* Litmus (from lichens)
* Red rose extract

---

### âœ… **3. What is litmus? How is it used to test substances?**

**Answer:**
Litmus is a natural dye obtained from **lichens**. It is used in the form of **litmus paper** (red and blue).

* **Blue litmus turns red in acidic solutions.**
* **Red litmus turns blue in basic solutions.**

---

### âœ… **4. What are acid-base indicators? Give two examples.**

**Answer:**
Substances that change their **color in acidic and basic media** are called **acid-base indicators**.
Examples:

* **Litmus**
* **Turmeric**
* **Red rose extract**

---

### âœ… **5. What is a neutralisation reaction? Write its general form.**

**Answer:**
When an acid reacts with a base to form **salt** and **water**, the reaction is called a **neutralisation reaction**.
This reaction is always accompanied by the **release of heat**.
**General form**:
`Acid + Base â†’ Salt + Water + Heat`

---

### âœ… **6. Write one example of a neutralisation reaction from daily life.**

**Answer:**
When an ant bites, it injects **formic acid** into the skin. Rubbing **baking soda** (a base) helps to **neutralise the acid** and gives relief from the pain.

---

### âœ… **7. How can turmeric be used as an indicator?**

**Answer:**
Turmeric paper turns **red in basic solutions** but shows **no color change** in acidic or neutral solutions.
Hence, turmeric is used to detect basic substances.

---

### âœ… **8. What are olfactory indicators? Give an example.**

**Answer:**
**Olfactory indicators** are substances whose **smell (odour) changes** in acidic or basic solutions.
Example: **Onion juice** or **vanilla essence**.

---

### âœ… **9. Why do we use organic matter in basic soil?**

**Answer:**
Organic matter (like compost or manure) releases **acids** which help to **neutralise** the **basic nature** of the soil.

---

### âœ… **10. What do you conclude if a substance:**

* **(a)** Turns blue litmus red
* **(b)** Turns red rose extract green
* **(c)** Shows no effect on either litmus

**Answer:**

* (a) The substance is **acidic**.
* (b) The substance is **basic**.
* (c) The substance is **neutral**.
