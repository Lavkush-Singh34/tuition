### 🟢 **Short Answer Type Questions**

**Q1. What is an electric cell?**  
→ An electric cell is a portable source of electrical energy with two terminals—positive (+) and negative (−).

**Q2. What is a battery?**  
→ A battery is a combination of two or more cells connected together to provide more energy or longer usage.

**Q3. What is a filament in an incandescent lamp?**  
→ It is a thin wire inside the bulb that glows when electric current passes through it.

**Q4. Why do we use metal wires in electric circuits?**  
→ Because metals are good conductors of electricity and allow current to flow easily.

**Q5. What is an electric circuit?**  
→ A complete path through which electric current flows from the positive terminal to the negative terminal of the cell.

**Q6. Why does an LED not glow if its terminals are connected wrongly?**  
→ Because current can flow through an LED in only one direction—from its positive to its negative terminal.

### 🧪 **Application-Based Questions**

**Q1. Why does a lamp glow in some circuit arrangements and not in others?**  
→ Because the lamp glows only when the circuit is complete and current flows properly between the terminals of the cell and the lamp.

**Q2. What will happen if a student does not remove the plastic insulation from the wires while making a circuit?**  
→ The lamp will not glow because plastic is an insulator and will block the flow of current.

**Q3. What should be done if an LED does not glow in a circuit?**  
→ Reverse its connections and ensure that the longer wire (positive terminal) is connected to the positive terminal of the battery.

### 🔲 **Diagram-Based Question**

**Q4. Draw and label a simple electric circuit using symbols (electric cell, switch, lamp, wires).**  
→ Students should use the standard symbols for electric cell (long + short lines), switch (open or closed), connecting wires, and lamp.
