## 📘 Chapter 2: **Arithmetic Expressions** – Full Explanation

---

### 🔹 **2.1 Simple Expressions**

#### ✅ **What is an Arithmetic Expression?**

An arithmetic expression is a combination of numbers and operations (+, –, ×, ÷).

**Examples:**

* 13 + 2 → Value = 15
* 18 ÷ 3 → Value = 6

➡️ The expression 13 + 2 = 15 means: "13 plus 2 is equal to 15"

---

### 🔹 **Using Expressions in Real Life**

**Example:**

* Mallika spends ₹25 per day for lunch. How much in 5 days?
  → Expression: **5 × 25 = 125**

#### ✨ **Same Value, Different Expressions:**

Value of 12 can be written as:

* 10 + 2
* 15 – 3
* 3 × 4
* 24 ÷ 2

➡️ This helps students understand that **expressions are flexible representations of values.**

---

### 🔹 **Comparing Expressions**

Use **‘=’, ‘<’, ‘>’** to compare values of expressions.

**Examples:**

* 10 + 2 > 7 + 1 because 12 > 8
* 13 – 2 < 4 × 3 because 11 < 12

Teach through relatable stories:

* Raja: 1023 + 125 marbles
* Joy: 1022 + 128 marbles → Joy has more because he got 3 more despite having 1 less initially.

---

### 🔹 **2.2 Reading and Evaluating Complex Expressions**

#### ✅ **Why Use Brackets?**

To avoid confusion about the order of operations.

**Example:**

* 30 + 5 × 4
  Without bracket → some may add first: (30+5) × 4 = 140 ❌
  Correct method → 30 + (5×4) = 30 + 20 = 50 ✅

Use **BODMAS Rule**:

* B – Brackets
* O – Orders (exponents)
* D – Division
* M – Multiplication
* A – Addition
* S – Subtraction

---

### 🔹 **Terms in Expressions**

Terms are parts of an expression separated by addition:

* 13 – 2 + 6 → Terms: 13, –2, 6

**Important**:
Convert subtraction into addition of the inverse:

* 83 – 14 → 83 + (–14)

---

### 🔹 **Properties of Addition**

#### 1. **Commutative Property**:

* Order doesn’t matter:
  $a + b = b + a$

#### 2. **Associative Property**:

* Grouping doesn’t matter:
  $(a + b) + c = a + (b + c)$

✅ Use this to quickly rearrange and solve expressions mentally.

---

### 🔹 **Distributive Property**

Multiplication distributes over addition:

* $a \times (b + c) = a \times b + a \times c$

**Example:**

* 2 × (43 + 24) = 2 × 43 + 2 × 24

Used in real-life:

* 3 people order ₹43 cutlet + ₹24 sweet
  → Total = 3 × (43 + 24)

---

### 🔹 **Removing Brackets**

#### ✅ Rule 1: Bracket after minus → Change signs

* 100 – (15 + 56) = 100 – 15 – 56

#### ✅ Rule 2: Bracket after plus → Keep signs same

* 28 + (35 – 10) = 28 + 35 – 10

---

### 🔹 **Tinker with Terms**

**Example:**

* 53 – 16 = 37
  What if you increase 53 by 1?
  → 54 – 16 = 38

➡️ Small changes in terms = small changes in answer. Use logic, not full calculations.

---

### 🔹 **2.3 Real-Life Problems Using Expressions**

**Examples:**

1. **Raghu** has 100 kg rice packed into 2 kg bags. Already had 4 bags.
   → Expression: 4 + 100 ÷ 2 = 54 bags

2. **Lhamo and Norbu** eat 1 cutlet (₹43) + 1 sweet (₹24) each
   → Expression: 2 × (43 + 24) = 2 × 67 = 134

---

### 🔹 **Mental Math Strategies**

**Example:**

* 97 × 25
  → (100 – 3) × 25
  \= 100 × 25 – 3 × 25
  \= 2500 – 75 = 2425

This is faster than long multiplication!

## 📘 Summary of Key Properties:

| Property                                    | Example                       |
| ------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| **Commutative** (a + b = b + a)             | 2 + 3 = 3 + 2 = 5             |
| **Associative** ((a + b) + c = a + (b + c)) | (1 + 2) + 3 = 1 + (2 + 3) = 6 |
| **Distributive** a(b + c) = ab + ac         | 3 × (4 + 5) = 3×4 + 3×5 = 27  |

### 🔹 **Teaching Tips for You**

1. **Use Stories and Visuals**
   Like the Mallika, Irfan, Raja–Joy examples. Students love character-based learning.

2. **Use Tokens or Color Counters**
   When teaching terms and inverse (for – numbers), use red/green tokens.

3. **Mental Math Challenges**
   Give students numbers and ask them to mentally rewrite:

   * (a + b) – c
   * a × (b + c)
   * a + b × c
