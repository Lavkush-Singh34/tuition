Here’s a **full set of short and long Q\&A** for the *Motions of the Earth* chapter so you can directly use them for teaching and student revision.

## **A. Short Answer Questions with Answers**

1. **What is rotation?**
   Rotation is the spinning of the Earth on its axis from west to east, taking 24 hours to complete one turn.

2. **What is revolution?**
   Revolution is the movement of the Earth around the Sun in a fixed orbit, taking 365¼ days.

3. **What is the tilt of the Earth’s axis?**
   The Earth’s axis is tilted at 23½° from the vertical.

4. **Name two effects of the rotation of the Earth.**

   * Causes day and night.
   * Causes apparent movement of the Sun across the sky.

5. **Why do we have leap years?**
   Because a year is 365¼ days long, an extra day is added every four years to keep the calendar in alignment.

6. **When does the Summer Solstice occur?**
   On 21 June, when the Northern Hemisphere is tilted towards the Sun.

7. **When does the Winter Solstice occur?**
   On 22 December, when the Southern Hemisphere is tilted towards the Sun.

8. **What happens during an equinox?**
   Day and night are equal all over the world because the Sun’s rays fall directly on the equator.

9. **Name the two equinoxes in a year.**

   * Spring (Vernal) Equinox – 21 March.
   * Autumn Equinox – 23 September.

10. **Which motion of the Earth causes seasons?**
    Revolution of the Earth combined with the tilt of its axis.

## **B. Long Answer Questions with Answers**

1. **Explain the effects of the rotation of the Earth.**

   * **Day and Night:** As Earth rotates, one half faces the Sun (day) while the other half is in shadow (night).
   * **Apparent Sun Movement:** The Sun appears to rise in the east and set in the west.
   * **Time Differences:** Different longitudes experience different local times.

2. **Describe the revolution of the Earth and its effects.**
   The Earth revolves around the Sun in 365¼ days along an elliptical orbit.
   **Effects:**

   * **Seasons:** Tilt of the axis causes variation in sunlight received in different regions.
   * **Length of Day and Night:** Changes throughout the year.
   * **Change in Sun’s Position:** Sun appears to move northwards and southwards.

3. **What are solstices? Explain with dates.**

   * **Summer Solstice (21 June):** Northern Hemisphere tilted towards the Sun; longest day and shortest night in the north.
   * **Winter Solstice (22 December):** Southern Hemisphere tilted towards the Sun; longest day in the south.

4. **What are equinoxes? Explain with dates.**
   Equinox occurs when the Sun’s rays fall directly on the equator, making day and night equal all over the Earth.

   * **Spring (Vernal) Equinox:** 21 March.
   * **Autumn Equinox:** 23 September.

5. **Why is the tilt of the Earth’s axis important?**
   The 23½° tilt causes uneven heating of the Earth during revolution, which creates seasons and varying lengths of day and night.

3. The Vernal Equinox occurs on 21 March. **True**
4. A leap year occurs every three years. **False**
5. Revolution takes 365¼ days. **True**
