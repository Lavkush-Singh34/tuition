**1. What is malleability? Give examples.**
Malleability is the property of metals by which they can be beaten into thin sheets. Examples: gold, silver, aluminium.

**2. Name a metal found in liquid state at room temperature.**
Mercury.

**3. What is ductility?**
The property of metals by which they can be drawn into wires, e.g., copper, aluminium.

**4. What is sonority?**
The property of metals to produce a ringing sound when struck.

**5. Why are cooking vessels made of metals?**
Because metals are good conductors of heat.

**6. Why are screwdriver handles made of plastic?**
Plastic is a poor conductor of electricity, so it prevents electric shock.

**7. What is corrosion?**
Gradual damage to metal surfaces caused by air, water, or other substances.

**8. What is rusting?**
Formation of brown deposits (rust) on iron when it comes in contact with moist air.

**9. How can rusting be prevented?**
By painting, oiling, greasing, or galvanising iron.

**10. What type of oxide is formed when magnesium burns in air?**
Basic oxide (magnesium oxide).

**11. What type of oxide is formed when sulfur burns in air?**
Acidic oxide (sulfur dioxide â†’ sulfurous acid).

**12. Give two properties of non-metals.**
Non-metals are generally non-lustrous and poor conductors of heat and electricity.

**13. Name two non-metals essential in daily life.**
Oxygen (respiration), nitrogen (fertilisers).

**14. Why is sodium stored in kerosene?**
It reacts vigorously with oxygen and water, so kerosene prevents contact with air/moisture.

**15. What is an element?**
A substance that cannot be broken into simpler substances.
