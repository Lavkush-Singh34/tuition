## üìò Chapter 1: **Rational Numbers ‚Äì Complete Explanation**

---

### üîπ **1.1 Introduction to Rational Numbers**

In earlier classes, we studied:

* **Natural Numbers**: 1, 2, 3, 4, ...
* **Whole Numbers**: 0, 1, 2, 3, ...
* **Integers**: ..., ‚Äì3, ‚Äì2, ‚Äì1, 0, 1, 2, 3, ...

However, these sets aren't sufficient for solving all equations.
Example:

* $x + 18 = 5 \Rightarrow x = -13$ ‚Üí requires **integers**
* $2x = 3 \Rightarrow x = \frac{3}{2}$ ‚Üí requires **rational numbers**

So we introduce **rational numbers**, which are numbers of the form:

$$
\frac{p}{q}, \text{ where } p, q \in \text{integers and } q \ne 0
$$

**Examples:**

$$
\frac{2}{3},\quad -\frac{5}{7},\quad \frac{-9}{4},\quad 0,\quad 5
$$

## üîπ **1.2 Properties of Rational Numbers**

---

### ‚úÖ **1.2.1 Closure Property**

A set is **closed** under an operation if the result of the operation between any two elements of the set is still in the set.

#### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Whole Numbers:

* ‚úÖ Addition: Closed
* ‚ùå Subtraction: Not closed
* ‚úÖ Multiplication: Closed
* ‚ùå Division: Not closed

#### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Integers:

* ‚úÖ Addition: Closed
* ‚úÖ Subtraction: Closed
* ‚úÖ Multiplication: Closed
* ‚ùå Division: Not closed

#### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Rational Numbers:

* ‚úÖ Addition: Closed
* ‚úÖ Subtraction: Closed
* ‚úÖ Multiplication: Closed
* ‚ùå Division: Not closed (when dividing by zero)

---

### ‚úÖ **1.2.2 Commutativity**

An operation is **commutative** if:

$$
a \ast b = b \ast a
$$

#### For Rational Numbers:

* ‚úÖ Addition: Commutative

  $$
  \frac{2}{3} + \frac{5}{7} = \frac{5}{7} + \frac{2}{3}
  $$
* ‚ùå Subtraction: Not commutative
* ‚úÖ Multiplication: Commutative

  $$
  \frac{2}{3} \times \frac{5}{7} = \frac{5}{7} \times \frac{2}{3}
  $$
* ‚ùå Division: Not commutative

---

### ‚úÖ **1.2.3 Associativity**

An operation is **associative** if:

$$
a \ast (b \ast c) = (a \ast b) \ast c
$$

#### For Rational Numbers:

* ‚úÖ Addition: Associative
* ‚ùå Subtraction: Not associative
* ‚úÖ Multiplication: Associative
* ‚ùå Division: Not associative

---

### ‚úÖ **1.2.4 Identity Elements**

* **Additive Identity (0)**:

  $$
  a + 0 = 0 + a = a
  $$

  For example: $\frac{3}{5} + 0 = \frac{3}{5}$

* **Multiplicative Identity (1)**:

  $$
  a \times 1 = 1 \times a = a
  $$

  For example: $\frac{-4}{7} \times 1 = \frac{-4}{7}$

---

### ‚úÖ **1.2.5 Distributivity**

**Distributive property of multiplication over addition and subtraction:**

For all rational numbers $a, b, c$:

$$
a \times (b + c) = a \times b + a \times c  
$$

$$
a \times (b - c) = a \times b - a \times c
$$

**Example:**

$$
\frac{3}{4} \times \left( \frac{2}{3} + \frac{5}{6} \right) = \frac{3}{4} \times \frac{2}{3} + \frac{3}{4} \times \frac{5}{6}
$$

## ‚ú® Tips to Teach This in Class:

* Use **real-life examples**: pizza slices, money sharing, temperature.
* Draw number lines to visualize rational numbers.
* Use **color-coded flashcards** for properties (closure, commutative, etc.).
* Create **group activities** for verifying properties through examples.
