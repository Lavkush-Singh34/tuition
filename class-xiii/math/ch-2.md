Here is a complete explanation of all key concepts from **Class 8 Maths Chapter 2: Linear Equations in One Variable**, based on the NCERT textbook:

## 📘 Chapter 2: **Linear Equations in One Variable – Full Explanation**

---

### 🔹 **2.1 What is a Linear Equation in One Variable?**

An **algebraic equation** is an equality that involves variables.
It has:

* **LHS (Left Hand Side)** of the ‘=’ sign
* **RHS (Right Hand Side)** of the ‘=’ sign

✅ **Linear equation**: An equation where the **highest power of the variable is 1**.

**Examples of linear expressions:**

* 2x + 3
* y – 7
* 4z – 5

**Non-linear examples (not allowed in this chapter):**

* x² + 2
* y² + y + 1
* z³ + z

✅ **Linear equation in one variable**: An equation where:

* Only **one variable** (e.g., x or y or z) appears
* Variable is raised to **power 1**

**Examples:**

* 5x = 20
* 3x – 7 = 8
* 2x – 5 = x + 4

---

### 🔹 **2.2 Solving Linear Equations**

The goal is to **isolate the variable** on one side.

**Basic Steps:**

1. Simplify both sides.
2. Use addition/subtraction to move constants.
3. Use multiplication/division to solve for the variable.
4. Always do the **same operation** on both sides to keep the equation balanced.

---

### 🔸 **Case 1: Variable on One Side**

**Example:**
$2x + 5 = 13$

**Solution:**

* Subtract 5 from both sides:
  $2x = 13 – 5 = 8$
* Divide both sides by 2:
  $x = \frac{8}{2} = 4$

---

### 🔸 **Case 2: Variable on Both Sides**

**Example:**
$3x + 2 = x + 10$

**Solution:**

* Subtract x from both sides:
  $2x + 2 = 10$
* Subtract 2 from both sides:
  $2x = 8$
* Divide by 2:
  $x = 4$

---

### 🔸 **Case 3: Using Transposition**

Instead of subtracting, you can **transpose** a term by changing its side and sign.

**Example:**
$5x + 2 = 3x + 10$

* Transpose 3x:
  $5x – 3x = 10 – 2$
* Solve:
  $2x = 8 \Rightarrow x = 4$

---

### 🔸 **Case 4: Equations with Fractions**

**Example:**

$$
\frac{1}{2}x + \frac{1}{3} = \frac{7}{6}
$$

**Solution:**

* Find LCM of 2, 3, 6 = 6
* Multiply whole equation by 6:

  $$
  6 \left( \frac{1}{2}x + \frac{1}{3} \right) = 6 \cdot \frac{7}{6}
  \Rightarrow 3x + 2 = 7
  \Rightarrow 3x = 5 \Rightarrow x = \frac{5}{3}
  $$

---

### 🔸 **Case 5: Equations with Brackets**

**Example:**

$$
5x – 2(2x – 3) = 3(x + 1)
$$

**Solution:**

* Expand brackets:

  $$
  5x – 4x + 6 = 3x + 3
  \Rightarrow x + 6 = 3x + 3
  \Rightarrow x – 3x = 3 – 6 \Rightarrow –2x = –3 \Rightarrow x = \frac{3}{2}
  $$

---

### 🔸 **Case 6: Decimal Coefficients**

**Example:**

$$
0.4x – 0.3 = 0.5x – 0.8
$$

**Solution:**

* Move variables and constants:

  $$
  0.4x – 0.5x = –0.8 + 0.3 \Rightarrow –0.1x = –0.5 \Rightarrow x = \frac{–0.5}{–0.1} = 5
  $$

---

### 🔸 **Checking the Solution**

**Always check** by substituting your value of x back into the original equation to verify LHS = RHS.
