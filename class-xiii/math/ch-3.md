### Important Notes on Polygons

- Polygons are 2-D figures with more than 3 sides.
- The angles of a regular polygon can be measured by using the following formulas:
- Exterior Angle = 360º/n
- Interior angle = 180º(n-2)/n, where n refers to the number of sides.
- The sum of interior and exterior angles at a point is always 180º as they form a linear pair of angles
- For an 'n'-sided polygon, the number of diagonals can be calculated with this formula, n(n-3)/2

## 📘 Chapter 3: Understanding Quadrilaterals

## 🧩 **Topics Covered in the Chapter**

### 1. **Polygons**

* **Definition**: A polygon is a simple closed figure made up of line segments.
* **Convex Polygon**: All interior angles < 180°, no line segment between any two points lies outside the polygon.
* **Concave Polygon**: At least one angle > 180°, and some segments may lie outside.

🧑‍🏫 **Teaching Tip**: Use diagrams and paper cutting to help visualize the difference.

---

### 2. **Regular and Irregular Polygons**

* **Regular**: All sides and angles are equal (e.g., square, equilateral triangle).
* **Irregular**: Sides or angles are not equal (e.g., rectangle, scalene triangle).

🧑‍🏫 **Explain with shapes students already know, like squares, rectangles, and triangles.**

---

### 3. **Exterior Angles of Polygons**

* **Sum of exterior angles** of any polygon is **360°**.
* **Each exterior angle** = 360° / number of sides (for regular polygons).

✅ **Example**: Each exterior angle of a regular hexagon = 360° ÷ 6 = 60°.

### 4. **Types of Quadrilaterals**

Quadrilaterals are polygons with **4 sides**.

#### a. **Trapezium**

* One pair of opposite sides is parallel.
* **Isosceles trapezium**: Non-parallel sides are equal.

#### b. **Kite**

* Two pairs of **equal adjacent sides**.
* One diagonal **bisects** the other.
* Diagonals intersect at **right angles**.

#### c. **Parallelogram**

* Both pairs of **opposite sides are parallel**.
* **Properties**:

  * Opposite sides are equal.
  * Opposite angles are equal.
  * Adjacent angles are supplementary.
  * Diagonals bisect each other.

#### d. **Rhombus**

* All sides are equal.
* Diagonals bisect each other at **right angles**.

#### e. **Rectangle**

* Opposite sides equal.
* All angles are **90°**.
* Diagonals are **equal** and bisect each other.

#### f. **Square**

* All sides are equal.
* All angles are **90°**.
* Diagonals are **equal**, **bisect**, and **perpendicular**.

🧑‍🏫 **Use cut-outs, paper folding, or geo boards for hands-on exploration.**
